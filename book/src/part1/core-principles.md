# Core Principles

Profesor is built on four key principles from the Toyota Production System, adapted for educational technology.

## The Toyota Way in Education

The Toyota Production System (TPS) revolutionized manufacturing by focusing on continuous improvement and waste elimination. These same principles apply remarkably well to learning systems:

| TPS Principle | Manufacturing Context | Learning Context |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Jidoka | Stop the line on defects | Stop on errors, provide immediate feedback |
| Poka-Yoke | Design fixtures that prevent mistakes | Structure exercises to prevent confusion |
| Kaizen | Small, continuous improvements | Progressive learning in small steps |
| Mieruka | Visual management boards | Progress dashboards and visualizations |

## Why These Principles Matter

Traditional e-learning often fails because it:

1. **Delays feedback** - Learners wait until the end to see scores
2. **Allows errors to compound** - Wrong mental models persist
3. **Lacks structure** - Free-form exercises lead to confusion
4. **Hides progress** - No clear sense of advancement

Profesor addresses each of these issues through systematic application of TPS principles.

## Principle Overview

### [Jidoka: Immediate Feedback](./jidoka.md)

Every answer receives immediate, detailed feedback. When a learner makes an error, the system stops and explains:
- What went wrong
- Why it's wrong
- How to fix it

### [Poka-Yoke: Error Prevention](./poka-yoke.md)

Questions and labs are structured to prevent common mistakes:
- Multiple choice questions have clear, distinct options
- Labs have step-by-step guidance
- Code exercises include starter templates

### [Kaizen: Continuous Improvement](./kaizen.md)

Content is organized in progressive difficulty:
- Module 1 builds foundation
- Module 2 builds on Module 1
- Each lesson is 15-30 minutes for consistent pace

### [Mieruka: Visual Management](./mieruka.md)

Abstract concepts are made concrete through:
- Physics simulations
- Progress tracking dashboards
- Visual feedback on quiz performance

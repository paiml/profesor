    # Welcome to Rust

    Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.
    It accomplishes these goals without a garbage collector, making it useful for
    performance-critical services and embedded systems.

    ## Your First Rust Program

    Every Rust program starts with a `main` function:

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    ```

    Let's break this down:

    - `fn` declares a new function
    - `main` is the entry point of every Rust program
    - `println!` is a macro (note the `!`) that prints to the console
    - Statements end with semicolons `;`

    ## Variables

    In Rust, variables are immutable by default:

    ```rust
    let x = 5;      // immutable
    let mut y = 10; // mutable (can be changed)

    // x = 6;       // Error! Cannot assign twice to immutable variable
    y = 20;         // OK, y is mutable
    ```

    ## Why Rust?

    1. **Memory Safety**: No null pointers, no dangling pointers
    2. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level features with no runtime overhead
    3. **Fearless Concurrency**: The type system prevents data races

    ## Key Concepts to Learn

    - Ownership and Borrowing
    - Structs and Enums
    - Pattern Matching
    - Error Handling with Result
    - Traits (similar to interfaces)

questions:
  - type: multiple_choice
    id: q1
    prompt: "What keyword is used to declare an immutable variable in Rust?"
    options:
      - "var"
      - "let"
      - "const"
      - "mut"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "In Rust, `let` declares a variable. By default, variables are immutable. Use `let mut` for mutable variables."

  - type: multiple_choice
    id: q2
    prompt: "Which of the following is NOT a scalar type in Rust?"
    options:
      - "i32"
      - "bool"
      - "String"
      - "char"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "String is a compound type (a growable, heap-allocated string). Scalar types are integers, floats, booleans, and characters."
    points: 10

  - type: multiple_choice
    id: q3
    prompt: "What does the `!` in `println!` indicate?"
    options:
      - "It's an error"
      - "It's a macro"
      - "It's a reference"
      - "It's mutable"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "The `!` indicates a macro call in Rust. Macros are expanded at compile time and can do things functions cannot."

  - type: code_completion
    id: q4
    prompt: "Complete the function to return the sum of two integers:"
    code_template: |
      fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
          {{blank1}}
      }
    blanks:
      - id: blank1
        acceptable_answers:
          - "a + b"
          - "return a + b;"
          - "return a + b"
          - "a+b"
        hint: "Use the + operator and remember implicit returns"
    test_cases:
      - name: "basic addition"
        input: "add(2, 3)"
        expected: "5"
      - name: "negative numbers"
        input: "add(-1, 1)"
        expected: "0"

  - type: multiple_select
    id: q5
    prompt: "Which of the following are valid integer types in Rust? (Select all that apply)"
    options:
      - "i32"
      - "u64"
      - "int"
      - "usize"
    correct: [0, 1, 3]
    explanation: "`int` is not a valid Rust type. Rust uses explicit size types like i32, u64, and architecture-dependent types like usize."

  - type: ordering
    id: q6
    prompt: "Order these steps to compile and run a Rust program:"
    items:
      - "Write code in main.rs"
      - "Run `cargo build`"
      - "Execute the binary"
      - "Create project with `cargo new`"
    correct_order: [3, 0, 1, 2]
    explanation: "First create the project, then write code, build it, and finally execute."

  - type: freeform_code
    id: q7
    prompt: "Write a function `is_even` that returns true if a number is even."
    language: rust
    starter_code: |
      fn is_even(n: i32) -> bool {
          // Your code here

      - name: "even number"
        input: "is_even(4)"
        expected: "true"

        input: "is_even(7)"
